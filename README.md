# GameOfLife

## Overview
Conwayâ€™s Game of life is a form of cellular automaton which means the system evolves based on initial input. Interestingly enough it manages to be Turing complete and can simulate an universal controller or other Turing machine basically acting like a modern computer with unlimited memory. The idea of this project is simply to create an expandable playground for a cellular automaton in processing starting with the Game of life. This will allow for further implementation of other sort of automatons like Wolfram's 1D.
